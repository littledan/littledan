I'm Daniel Ehrenberg (he/him or they/them), an engineer working in various standards bodies, to improve JavaScript, WebAssembly and the Web Platform. I want to make computers more open and easy to program for everyone.

I work at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/) as a software engineer. Previously, I worked at [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/), an open source consultancy, which counts Bloomberg among its clients.

To learn about my work, you can watch some of the talks I've given about it. I like to give talks in various groups of JavaScript developers, to explain how TC39 works, encourage people to get involved, and learn more about different developers' needs.

I've worked on a number of proposals in TC39, the JavaScript standards committee, including:
- **Finished standards** (Stage 4):
  - [BigInt](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint): Arbitrary-precision integers in JavaScript
  - [Class fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/) and [private methods](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-methods)
  - RegExp features: [named capture groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-named-groups) [lookbehind assertions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-lookbehind), [Unicode property escapes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes)
  - [WeakRefs](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs): Weak references and finalizers
  - [Top-level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await): Asynchronous module evaluation
- **Late-stage proposals** (Stage 3):
  - [Import assertions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions) and [JSON modules](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules): Support for multiple module types in JS
  - [Realms](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms/):  Multiple isolated but synchronously interacting globals in JavaScript
  - [Temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/): New date/time library built-in to JS
- **Earlier-stage proposals** (Stage 1-2):
  - [Records and Tuples](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple): Immutable data structures
  - [Decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators): Extensible classes
  - [Module fragments](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-fragments) and [module blocks](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-js-module-blocks):  Inline modules in JavaScript to improve bundling and Web Worker deployment

I've also worked in other areas of standards, including:
- [ECMA-402](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/) (`Intl`): Organized subcommittee and championed several feature proposals
- WebAssembly:
  - Edited the initial WebAssembly [JS API](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-js-api-1/) and [Web API](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-web-api-1/) specifications
  - Created the [WebAssembly BigInt integration proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration)
  - Edited the [WebAssembly ESM integration proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/tree/master/proposals/esm-integration)
  - Going forward, I'm really excited about the [Wasm GC proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/gc) but haven't managed to help much yet
- [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) (e.g., integrations of TC39 proposals)
- [WebIDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) (e.g., formalizations)

In a past life at Google, I worked on Linux kernel/firmware stuff to improve access to SSDs. As part of that, I wrote [a popular introduction to Linux AIO](https://github.com/littledan/linux-aio) and even landed [some very basic upstream kernel patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Ehrenberg).
